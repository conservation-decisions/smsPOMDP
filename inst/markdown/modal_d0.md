This is usually a yearly probability of detection. 

Given the population is locally persisting, this is the probability of detecting that a local population is locally persisting when no action is performed. 

This field assumes a moderate monitoring effort, examples include:Random sighting

Realistically, given a local population is persisting, what are the chances of detecting its persistence if no action is conducted?

Note that we assume there cannot be false positive.
