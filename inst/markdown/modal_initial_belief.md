We usually assume that the population is locally persisting (initial belief = 1) as a starting plan. However, if there is a doubt on the current status of the population, this question can either be answered by:
* Entering additional information regarding past history of management actions and observations
* Providing an estimate “realistically, what are the chances that the current population is locally persiting?”

Note that if the belief is 0 then that means that the population is locally extinct and it is assumed that it will not persist without a dedicated de-extinction program.
