This field represent a yearly source of income and can be interpreted as the economic value of a species.

We realise this value might be difficult to get/estimate. We recommend running a sensitivity analysis to see how it influences the recommendations.

* Default value: This option assumes we provide the same value for all species belonging to the same management streams. Acknowledging for example that iconic species have higher economic value than site-managed or landscape managed species. This value could be set up as a default value by SoS. What if we donâ€™t have a value? (100M/5)/Number of species.
* Replacement cost: An alternative is to consider its replacement cost. If the population went locally extinct, How much would it cost to implement a successful captive breeding program and reinstate former locally extinct populations?
* Donation: How much money is raised on average for the conservation of this species?
* Ecosystem services contribution: some species are more likely to provide an important ecosystem services contribution.
* In absence of data: use a multiplier of cost of management and perform sensitivity analysis.
