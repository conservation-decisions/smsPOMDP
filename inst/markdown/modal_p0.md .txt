This is usually a yearly probability of persistence. 

Realistically, what are the chances of a local population of species y go functionally extinct over x years if not managed?

An expert may think - or an analysis may show - there is a 10% chance that the local population will go functionally extinct over 10 years without management:
      $p(y=extinct, period= 10 years)= 0.10$

This extinction probability can then be expressed as a persistence probability over 10 years:
     $p(y=persist, period= 10 years)=0.9$

Which can then be expressed as a yearly probability:
    $p(y=persist, period= 1 year)= (0.9)^{\frac{1}{10}} = 0.98951$
