This is usually a yearly probability of detection. 

Given the population is locally persisting, this is the probability of detecting that a local population is locally persisting when management is performed. 

This field assumes a moderate monitoring effort, examples include:
Managing a large area;

Realistically, given a local population is persisting, what are the chances of detecting its persistence when management occurs?

Note that we assume there cannot be false positive.
