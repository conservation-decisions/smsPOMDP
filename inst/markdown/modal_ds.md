This is usually a yearly probability of detection. 

Given the population is locally persisting, this is the probability of detecting that a local population is locally persisting when management is performed. This field assumes a substantial effort occurs to detect a persisting population:
* Camera traps; Acoustic device; 
* Experts sent to the field to perform a proper survey with adequate dedicated funding;

Realistically, given a local population is persisting, what are the chances of detecting its persistence when surveillance occurs?

Note that we assume there cannot be false positive.
