This is usually a yearly probability of persistence. 

Realistically, what are the chances of a local population of species y go functionally extinct over x years managed?

An expert may think - or an analysis may show - there is a 5% chance that the local population will go functionally extinct over 20 years under management:
$p(y=extinct, period= 20 years)= 0.5$

This extinction probability can then be expressed as a persistence probability over 20 years:
$p(y=persist, period= 10 years)=0.95$

Which can then be expressed as a yearly probability:
$p(y=persist, period= 1 year)= (0.95)^{\frac{1}{20}} = 0.99743$
